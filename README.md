# About
This repository contains the python notebook and dataset I used to investigate the degree of influence that certain biometric factors have on predicting Alzheimer's Disease using machine learning.
# Alzheimers-Disease-Prediction-
In this study, I investigated the degree of influence that estimated total intracranial volume, normalized whole brain volume, gender, and socioeconomic status have on predicting Alzheimer's Disease. In order to do so, I ran 3 machine learning models - logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost using a dataset (oasis_longitudinal.csv) that included biometric data (included the aforementioned variables) about both demented and non-demented patients. I chose the "best" model by chosing the one with the best balance between accuracy and not underdiagnosing demented patients. In order to compare the degrees of influence that the variables have, I looked at the "feature importance" values of the variables outputted by the model. The reason I decided to conduct this investigation is because the causes of Alzheimer's Disease are not yet fully known so I wanted to contribute to the current bed of research by looking further into how my variables of interest can impact the risk of developing Alzherimer's as there are some preliminary studies suggesting their impact.
